### My Journey into Programming

I've been programming in one form or another since my teens.  In fact you can still download some of the first programs I made for the TI-83+ calculator over at [ticalc.org](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/65/6588.html).

After working with the **TI-83+ BASIC** programming language and some **Assembly** code for that calculator, I moved onto **Java**.  I spent a summer learning **Java** via a _Sam's Teach Yourself_ I got from the local library.

I dappled a bit with **HTML** before learning **Java**.  And **HTML** was partly why I chose to program in **Java**.  I wanted to get in on this thing called the _World Wide Web_ and **Java** could run in a browser.  Well once I found out about **Javascript** and discovered I could do most on the things it wanted to do on the web with it, I stop messing with **Java**.

I took a summer class one year that taught us how to model a 3D character and import into the game [Unreal Tournament 2003](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament_2003), which got me interested in 3D modeling.  When it came to picking out colleges I wasn't sure what I wanted to do for a living, so I went with [MSB](http://www.msbcollege.edu/) since they had a Game Development program that had a little bit of everything in it.  I took classes for programming(VB.NET,C,C++,Java,Flash), drawing, 3D modeling and animation, Database, and even Sound.  Two years later and I had an A.A.S. in Programming and Game Development.

After college I decided I preferred working on web development.  So I found a few jobs in that field, and that is where I am today.


### My Exploration with Linux

I became interested in Linux in my early High-school years.  I finally took the plunge when I found out about some nasty security/privacy rumors surrounding _Windows Longhorn_(the development code name for _Vista_).  Those rumors turned out to be false, but it was too late and I was hooked on Linux.

I started out with [Red Hat Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) installing one of the early versions, 2 or 3 I don't remember.  However I quickly moved away from it because "it looked too much like Windows", which was what I was trying to get away from in the first place.  So I decided to go all in and install [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/).  I used that for years and learned a lot about how Linux works.

Once I got tired of the long install times of Gentoo and having to compile _every_ application, I moved onto [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/).  I think was version 6.  Unfortunately, every time the version changed the upgrade would break my system, and I'd have to spend the day figuring out how to make my system usable again.

Which brings us to what I'm currently running, [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).  I started with _etch_ or _lenny_, and have been using it since.
